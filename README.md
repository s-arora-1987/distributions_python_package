# distributions_python_package
Python Package for Gaussian Distributions

Installation of package:

cd 3a_python_package
pip install .

Usage Example:

If everything is set up correctly, pip will install the distributions package into the workspace. You can then start the python interpreter from the terminal typing:
python

Then within the Python interpreter, you can use the distributions package:
from distributions import Gaussian
gaussian_one = Gaussian(25, 2)
gaussian_one.mean
gaussian_one + gaussian_one

etcetera...In other words, you can import and use the Gaussian class because the distributions package is now officially installed as part of your Python installation.
